Crosscompiling Maxima for Windows
=================================

This repository shows - using GitHub Actions workflows - how
to crosscompile a Windows installer for the CAS Maxima
(<https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/>).

What must be installed on Ubuntu 22.04 to create an installer.

See <https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/ci/master/tree/crosscompile-windows/README.txt>
for more information about this procedure.

Note: There were some difficulties in the Ubuntu package dependencies, but
as you can see, it works with these packages.
