Crosscompiling Maxima for Windows
=================================

This repository shows - using GitHub Actions workflows - how
to crosscompile a Windows installer for the CAS Maxima
(<https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/>).

What must be installed on Ubuntu 22.04 to create an installer.
The description of the (default) installed Software on the Github
images can be found here:
<https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2204-Readme.md>

See <https://sourceforge.net/p/maxima/code/ci/master/tree/crosscompile-windows/README.txt>
for more information about this procedure.

Note: There were some difficulties in the Ubuntu package dependencies, but
as you can see, it works with these packages.
